My name is Ammar Najjar

I am a software engineer, I code in passion, and that's where I spend most of my time.

I contribute to open source mainly on github. I also read a lot, technical and non-technical books, play chess and take photoes as a hobby.  

I live currenty in north Germany, and like being to conferences or local software user groups.  
For all about me, look me up on the social media.

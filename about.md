My name is Ammar Najjar

I am a software engineer who codes with passion and seek knowledge where accessible.  
For the professional info, look me up on the social media. I use my free time to
contribute to open source mainly on github. I also read a lot, technical and non-technical books, and play chess as a hobby.  
I live currenty in north Germany, and like being to conferences or local software user groups.

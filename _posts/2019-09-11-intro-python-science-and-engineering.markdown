### About the book:

- Author: David J. Pine
- ISBN: 978-1-138-58389-4 (Paperback)
- ISBN: 978-1-138-58390-0 (Hardback)

### Summery:

This book gives an introduction to python as a language, then dives into some engineering problems and how they can be solved using python:

- Plotting (matplotlib)
- Curve Fitting (linear regression and nonlinear least squares)
- Numerical Routines (SciPy and Numpy)
- Data manipulation (Pandas)
- Animation (matplotlib)
- Intro to Python GUI (PyQt)

### Opinion

I skipped the first few chapters and read only the chapters which introduce numpy, matplotlib, scipy and pandas.
I found it nice to read, and had a jupyter notebook open on the side, to try some examples. The examples were clear and easy to understand. I enjoyed reading it.

### Conclusion:

- Level: Intermediate
- I recommend it for students of information engineering, and who finished their degree.
